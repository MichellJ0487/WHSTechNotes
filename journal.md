The term “brain rot” evokes a vivid image of cognitive decline through overexposure to digital media, suggesting a sense of numbness that often follows hours of scrolling mindlessly through social feeds or binge-watching videos that offer little substance. For me, it encapsulates the feeling of becoming overly saturated with information and entertainment that, while momentarily engaging, fails to enrich my understanding or mental clarity. This year, my relationship with digital media has been a mixed bag; it has provided connection and knowledge, but also moments of stagnation and anxiety, particularly when social media fuels comparison or when news cycles overwhelm my emotional landscape.

Reflecting on last semester, I appreciated the collaborative projects and hands-on activities, which enriched my learning experience and allowed for the practical application of concepts. However, the pacing of the lessons could improve, as some topics felt rushed, making it difficult to fully understand complex materials. Looking forward to the new semester, I would like to focus on real-world applications, potentially through a capstone project, and explore new technologies like AI and data analytics. I also seek more interactive experiences, such as workshops and guest speakers.Lastly, I am interested in pursuing certifications in Python and Unity to enhance my skills. Access to study resources, such as online courses and practice exams, as well as guidance from instructors, would be beneficial in preparing for these certifications.

The potential ban on TikTok in the United States raises significant issues regarding the interplay between government regulation, technology companies, and user rights. Government intervention can lead to positive outcomes, such as enforcing data protection standards that safeguard user privacy, but it can also have negative effects, including stifling innovation and forcing companies to relocate operations to countries with less stringent laws. To address security concerns while operating globally, TikTok could implement robust data governance policies and maintain local data storage solutions.As a means to enhance user privacy, the proposal for a "Data Eraser" feature would empower users to delete their accounts and associated data securely. This feature would reinforce TikTok's commitment to privacy and reduce the necessity for external regulation. The situation emphasizes the importance of data governance, app development ethics, and user empowerment in technology. Developers should integrate these principles into their work, ensuring that technological advancements respect user rights and protect personal data, thus reflecting the lessons learned from the TikTok ban scenario. Concepts explored include data protection regulations, app design methodologies, software ethics, and the critical importance of balancing innovation with user security.
